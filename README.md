# TripleX mining algorithm

This is a draft for a combination of a new mining algorithm combining SHA3, Blake2b and Blake3 in a balanced way. Currently the multiplication of hashes is implemented but there is still a lot of work to do. This repo shall serve as an illustration for a mathematical paper explaining the theoretical (still to be written).
